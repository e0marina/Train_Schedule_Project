# Train_Schedule_Project

Link to deployed game: https://e0marina.github.io/Train_Schedule_Project/

This is a Javascript Train Scheduler app where the user can input their train name, destination,, the first train (in military time) and the train's frequency...once the user hits submit, the current train schedule updates (using Firebase) and the next arrival and mins away is calculated. I made this for UCLA's extension class.
